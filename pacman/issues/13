    "body": "Since actors will take a certain amount of steps every frame, we make them sychronize each step.  After one steps is taken by all the actors who need to take one, collision will be tested.  If there is a collision, we stop all stepping even if there are some left to be taken.  This is probably how the original game handled it.  I added a speed hack to pacman to test this new collision detection.",
