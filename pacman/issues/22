Each significant code block can have an associated formatted comment block that is displayed in the margin when requested by the reader.\r\n\r\nThis can be a combination of literate programming and docco by displaying a table of contents dictating the proper order that the code should be read.  It can also emphasize the importance of reading code in the order imposed by the language with an optional marginal block of comments describing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
