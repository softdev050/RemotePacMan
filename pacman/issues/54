    "body": "I left you a comment on Reddit about this. The \"safe spot\" or \"hiding place\" does work, but in your version it's harder to achieve stability with it due to the ghost behavior. In arcade Pac-Man, when the ghosts do their final scatter for the round, you can always go to the hiding place and they will not find you. But with yours, when Blinky returns to chase mode, he goes straight to the hiding place and finds Pac-Man. I ran into this same behavior when coding my Clojure version of Pac-Man, and the bug was due to bad tie-break logic when measuring the distance to target from potential tiles. The ghosts should prefer up, left, down, right-- in that order. This should give you better overall ghost behavior and also make the hiding place work as kind of an emergent property of the rules of the game and shape of the maze.",

    "body": "Doh!  The turns currently have clockwise priority, not counter-clockwise.  Thanks a lot for taking the time to catch and explain that!  (I wonder if this means the hiding spot is on the left side instead of the right side with the current priority.)\n\nAnd that's awesome that you used Clojure in your version, and you even have Jr. Pac-Man maps.  I'll be watching your project, and will check it out soon!",
