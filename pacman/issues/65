Maze should be 'pink' (and starting at board 18 the maze should be 'brown'), and then at 21 red again as on boards 6-9. That's what always helped me keep track of what board i was on, after board 21 i would count 4 repeating sets of 4 red/blue/pink/brown boards.  Of course, with the board counter at the bottom right (which is awesome!), this is kinda moot, but still... :)",
