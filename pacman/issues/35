  "body": "The aesthetics of the generated maps can be ruined by bad coloring.  We need to come up with a good algorithm for choosing two colors for coloring a random map. (fill and stroke)\n\nInitially, HSV color space with V=1 seems okay.  Perhaps find out statistically which hue differences look good at each hue.  We can probably press by choosing a wide sampling of fill/stroke color pairs that look decent, and trying to relate them.",

    "body": "I decided to create a more consistent experience in Cookie-Man by having the colors coincide with the level number.  An algorithm for a random color scheme offers an [interesting problem in color theory](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01200382757), but I believe it's less chaotic for the user to just experience the randomness of the maps through its structure and not its color.\n\nI should also note that I was unable to come up with a random color scheme generator that was consistently pleasant.",
