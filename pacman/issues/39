  "body": "In two player mode, there are two games being played, but not at the same time.  The first player starts their game and it continues as it would in single player mode, but when they die, the game switches to a new game for the second player.  The games continue to alternate to the other player after each death.  Each player has their own score and number of lives remaining.\n\nThe top of the screen is occupied by the following:\n\n    1UP         HIGH SCORE         2UP\n    XXXX            XXXX           XXXX\n\nDuring the first player's turn, \"1UP\" is blinking, meaning \"Player 1 is Up\".  Similarly, during the second player's turn, \"2UP\" is blinking, meaning \"Player 2 is Up\".  Each player's score is below their respective blinking indicator.\n\nIn the cocktail table version, the image is rotated 180 degrees when second player is up.",
