  "body": "PacWhiz says:\n\n> 3. Another thing i'm not too fond of (and one of the reasons i always liked Pac & PacPlus less) is the too many reverses in MsPac (and Cookie Man).  Can't complain about Cookie coz it's new 8), but MsPac... can't let that slide ;)  One at ~7s, one at ~25s, that should be it.\n\nanningmay says:\n\n> Anyhow, the reversals drove me crazy, like Aart. This is one of the problems I have with the iphone version of MsPac as well; two reversals in the first 30 seconds or so is all we need, thank you very much.  :)",
