  "body": "The first parts will be tutorial-oriented to teach the player about ghost behaviors, but will progress to more difficult puzzles that require intimate knowledge of the game's dynamics such as pellet lag, corner-drifting, fruit paths, ghost reversal times.\n\nOne particular situation is the act of being chased by blinky into a collision course with pinky.  One may be able to escape this fate by moving pacman back toward blinky at a particular moment to narrowly draw pinky away from blocking your path.\n\nLevels can progress to a puzzle aspect by combining elements from previous levels in quick succession, and introducing more complex dynamics.  I imagine it will take a lot of time creating challenging puzzles, but I think that is the natural progression that this project has lead to that needs to be done.",
