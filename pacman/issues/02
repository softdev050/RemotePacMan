    "body": "Started playing with the debugger in MAME to verify the four invisible tunnel tiles.  The MAME debugger window for linux seems to be broken.  I tried building it myself, but it failed on something cryptic.  Windows MAME works great though.\r\n\r\nThe following seem to be variables matching Pacman's pixel and tile location.  Though they appear in three other areas in memory, these are the first addresses.\r\n\r\n0x4D08 - Y pixel (top=0x14, bottom=0xF4)\r\n0x4D09 - X pixel (left=0xFF, right=0x00)\r\n0x4D39 - Y tile (top=0x22, bottom=0x3E)\r\n0x4D3A - X tile (left=0x3D, right=0x1E)\r\n\r\nThese were found by installing the mame cheats package.  From there, I enabled invincibility and started moving pacman around without fear of dying.  Then I used the debugger to search for changing values as I moved pacman around.  My search initially turned up nil because I assumed X was increasing to the right.\r\n\r\nThe limits listed above next to each variable are the absolute limits that pacman can travel on the map.  Four tiles are off the screen but the game still tracks him there, which confirms the four invisible tiles.",
