  "body": "The game NEEDS to run at 60fps to feel as smooth as the original.  \n\nA texture atlas needs to be created to improve the performance of the game.  Drawing all the sprites with bezier curves and other canvas paths is probably the culprit of the lag on my machine.  The game hangs for short spurts at times, so that may be another issue.",

    "body": "The texture atlas did not improve the performance of the game enough.  It still chokes at certain seemingly random moments in the game.  It runs perfectly on a new MacBook Pro, so I'm guessing processor speed is a factor.\n\nI will try to run it on cocoonjs to determine if more work will be needed to improve the performance of the game for mobile.",

After getting rid of an extra screen clear command, the game jumped 20 frames per second.\n\nOn my linux machine, it performs at ~60 fps fullscreen (1280x1024) in firefox, and ~30fps in chrome.  On windows xp, it performs at ~20 fps on both browsers.  On a new macbook pro, it runs at a consistent 62.5 fps.",
